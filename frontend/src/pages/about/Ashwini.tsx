                  Ashwini's name is derived from 'Ashva' which means horse. Ashvin means one who owns horses. This 
                  sign is ruled by Ashwini Kumars and they are twins. Hence, this sign signifies twins.
                </p>
                
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Generally, horses are representative of power and stamina. Ashwini Kumars who are the God of the 
                  Nakshatra are great surgeons, can do medical marvels, can restore health, beauty and vision as was 
                  illustrated in different ancient stories especially in hermit Chavan. They have bestowed health to all 
                  those who invoke their grace for their healing.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  In Rig Veda it is said that the Ashwinis can bring rain during a drought. It also says that once Ashwinis 
                  dug a hole in the desert and it became a well. This perhaps indicates that problems can be overcome 
                  by starting the efforts when planets, especially the Moon are well placed in Ashwini Nakshatra.
